```

Leave that terminal running and create a new terminal using the plus button on the top right of your terminal window.

### 1. Get inside the thecmdchallenge/ directory
```console
your@githubhandle âžœ /workspaces/your-repo-name (master):~$ cd thecmdchallenge/
your@githubhandle âžœ /workspaces/your-repo-name/thecmdchallenge (master) $ 
```
### 2. Print current directory path
```console
your@githubhandle âžœ /workspaces/your-repo-name/thecmdchallenge (master):~$ pwd
```
### 3. List all the files from the current directory including the hidden ones
```console
your@githubhandle âžœ /workspaces/your-repo-name/thecmdchallenge (master):~$ ls -a
.  ..  boringfolder  console_master.md  funcode  kamehameha  small-name
```
### 4. Now list all the files inside the project, recursively (all files in the hierarchy)

```
### 8. Create a new directory inside funcode/the-most-funny/ called â€œnot-that-funnyâ€œ

your@githubhandle âžœ /workspaces/your-repo-name/thecmdchallenge (master):~$ cp boringfolder/even-more-boring/i-cant-believe-how-boring/the-ultimate-boring-inception/the-mostboring-text.txt boringfolder/even-more-boring/i-cant-believe-how-boring/the-ultimate-boring-inception/lol.txt
